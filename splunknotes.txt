splunks job is to collect event data and analyze the event data

this is built as a sandbox to show security information
- security application 
- most people with Splunk on their resume is reading dashboards and emailing data to other people
    - if you can perform your own searches by hand, stats, table, eval, map, this makes you extremely valuable
        - abstract flags
            predict
            pivot
            overlap
            rex (field separation by regex)

splunk corporate has a splunk fundamentals class 
- youll need to learn basic internals that really is kind of boring on the front end
- doesnt really have any day-to-day applications in relation to security

github.com data sets
- Boss of the SOC
- 1 month interval of datasets
- https://github.com/splunk/botsv2
- https://lolbas-project.github.io/# - Living off the Land (fileless malware and abusing windows functions for fun and profit)

- splunk enterprise downloads
- you need to go to splunk.com and setup a splunk.com account
- splunk.com/downloads, free 60 day trial available
- use the BOTS dataset to recreate what we are doing here

this lesson is about splunk search and searching for specific events
- user interface
- basic search

within splunk, there are splunk apps:
- the only one we have at the moment is Search & Reporting
- Apps can do different things
    - maybe a Palo Alto app, pretty graphs
    - Palo Alto Networks Add-on for Splunk
    - Splunk is quite modular when it comes to apps and the things it can do

Search & Reporting
- case sensitive
- Know what timeframe you are looking for in a given period
- 24 hours? today? all time? realtime?
- Relative searching
- Realtime searches, as data comes in, it is passed to the search function
- read the documentation if you need to define your own search parameters:
   https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.0.3/Search/Selecttimerangestoapply?ref=hk
- Splunk Community is also a great resource but most of it is out of date
- Splunk Slack channel but you may need to be a Splunk customer and need to be invited
- Google is your friend (google.com then search "site:docs.splunk.com")

- Navigate to Presets, select interval, All Time

Indexes:
- different data can be configured here, some data you have to configure to index
- allows you to add data to different indexes and segregate duties to different users
- effectively a folder or directory on a disk

Roles:
- Search Head and Indexer
- In this case, both applications are running on the same server
- If you have more load, you can have additional search heads 

You can also specify time intervals on the commandline
- Specify the earliest day we want to look at and then the latest day we want to look at
- "index=botsv2 earliest=08/01/2017:00:00:00 latest=08/01/2017:01:59:59"
- Splunk can be very fast if you are narrowing down your search query

Events:
- can be any kind of data
- words
- temperatures, numerical data
- there is a large set of variability in what splunk events can have
- Default events:
    - _time - time that the event claims it happened (not the time splunk received the data)
    - host - device that splunk believes generated the event
        append events to the end of your search, like so:
        index=botsv2 earliest=08/01/2017:00:00:00 latest=08/01/2017:01:59:59 host=venus
        - would denote events from the host named venus
    - source - where the event was ingested from
        - Perfmon:Process
        - WinRegistry
    - sourcetype - type of data, rather than source
        - most environments, this will be the same, with UDP data, they may not be the same

searching tips:
- you can Shift+Enter to create a line break in the search field, useful for readability
- explicit search intervals in the search field will override the gui selectors for search intervals
- earliest=-5y, latest=now - this will show you the last 5 years of data, (relative from now)
    - same for minutes, hours etc...

Lets talk about Pipe commands
- Splunk supports piping data
- could pipe stuff to say the stats function
    - in this case we are just going to count stuff

    index=botsv2 
earliest=08/01/2017:00:00:00 
latest=08/01/2017:01:59:59
| stats count by sourcetype

- pipe the output of stats into count ("stats count by sourcetype | sort count desc"
    - there are lots and lots and lots of options for stats
- pipe into timechart 
    - visualize data ("click Visualization")

index=botsv2 
earliest=08/01/2017:00:00:00 
latest=08/01/2017:01:59:59
| timechart count by sourcetype

Modes
- Smart mode enabled
    - reads data out of index, adds data that it can to the menu on the left
- Fast mode
    - does not do field extraction
    - depending on data and disk, can be 2-3x faster than Smart mode (with field extraction)

Dashboards:
- make your search, Save as (top left corner above search button)
    - Save as Dashboard
        - we will build a dashboard
            - saves your query as a dashboard
            - name the dashboard, description
    - GUI dashboard for quick viewing

Sourcetypes:
- click and item in the search view to add it to the search:
index=botsv2  earliest=08/01/2017:00:00:00  latest=08/01/2017:23:59:59 sourcetype="wineventlog:security"
- make this data into a table, useful for limiting things for dashboards (where so much data would be overwhelming)
- stream:ip: src_ip, dest_ip, bytes_in, bytes_out
   
Searching specifics
- GPO will require you to manually enable the logging of New_Process creation
- netexe is the swissarmy knife
- SVC host is useful too but you have to know what its doing (it does a lot)
- powershell is often used because it is not flagged by antivirus, (but lots of things can be launched from here)
- New_Process_Name=*powershell*
- Process_Command_Line=*-enc*
    encoded powershell events in base64
- globbing commands *powershell*
    - not all located in the same place, so globe the absolute location
index=botsv2  earliest=08/01/2017:00:00:00  latest=08/31/2017:23:59:59 
sourcetype="wineventlog:security" EventCode=4688 New_Process_Name=*powershell* Process_Command_Line=*-enc*
this will locate a fileless malware attack (pipe the data into | base64 to decode and find out what this function is doing)

Firewall Traffic
- some data are not very good at separating data, 
    - may just give you comma delimited data that you will have to do something with  

Eval
- make new columns based on data
index=botsv2  earliest=08/01/2017:00:00:00  latest=08/31/2017:23:59:59 sourcetype="*" sourcetype="stream:ip"  src_ip="71.39.18.125" dest_ip="172.31.10.10"
| table src_ip dest_ip bytes_in bytes_out
| eval totalbytes=bytes_in+bytes_out
- adds a new column totalbytes that is the sum of bytes_in and bytes_out

Statistics
- standard deviation - statistic average away from the mean
index=botsv2  earliest=08/01/2017:00:00:00  latest=08/31/2017:23:59:59 sourcetype="*" sourcetype="stream:ip"
| stats  count by src_ip
| eventstats avg(count) as avg stdev(count) as stdev
| sort count desc
| eval deviation_threshold = avg+(2.5*stdev)
| eval toobig=if(count>deviation_threshold,1,0)
| table src_ip count deviation_threshold toobig
| search toobig=1


Takeaways:
- if things are happening too often, it may eat too much data for your License to handle
    - once youve indexed past that point, splunk stops letting you search for stuff
    - it will continue to index but gets cranky
    - cost is something like $1000/GB/day
    - if you can avoid spending extra money, you are more valuable
    - splunk becomes wayyy more powerful the more you tune it
    - tune it more to make it more precise, learn more about your environment and tune out the noise
