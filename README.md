# SplunkMisc
This is some skeletal work I did early in development of a splunk class I taught in early 2020. The original idea was to create a roughly four hour accelerated intro to provide the minimum skills needed by a technologist to be able to begin using splunk rapidly.

Yes, I know there are passwords in there. The subsequent versions of the scripts would autogenerate random passwords, output to STDOUT, and then move on. I figured this version would be better to share due to the transient (5h) nature of the environment.

I lost this data for about a year before I finally found the .sh on my kali VM. which makes perfect sense in retrospect.

This is example ONLY and will NOT work as-is.
